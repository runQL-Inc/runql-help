# What is a Certified Query?

A certified query is a query that has gone through a pull request (PR) review process.

To certify a query:
1. Save your query.
2. Navigate to the **Versions** tab.
3. Click the **Certify** button on the version you want certified.

This sends a notification to your teammates.  
They can visit **Certifications** to review and approve pending queries.

âœ… Once certified, a green checkmark appears next to the query version, indicating it is validated and trusted.
