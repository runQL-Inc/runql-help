# How to Import Queries

You can import `.sql` files into your workspace.  
Files can come from your desktop or be exported from Git.

## Important Notes
- The `.sql` file name becomes the saved query title.
- Each query (separated by a semicolon `;`) becomes a separate saved query.
- Comments before queries become the saved query descriptions.

## Import Steps
1. Open or create a workspace.
2. Attach at least one database.
3. Open the three-dot menu next to the workspace name.
4. Select **Import SQL Files**.
5. Select your `.sql` file or `.zip` archive of files.
6. Click **Import**.
