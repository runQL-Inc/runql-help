# What is a Shared Connection?

A **Shared Connection** is a database connection that:
- Uses one set of credentials shared across your organization.
- Credentials cannot be edited or viewed by others (except organizational admins).
- Admins can enable **Hidden Details** to hide the server hostname/IP and port as well.
